**Buddy:** If you can’t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that someone with the correct access completes that item_.

## New Person checklist

### Getting to know cloud.gov
- [ ] Take judicious notes on what about this onboarding process or cloud.gov is confusing or frustrating. If you notice a problem (especially with things like documentation), you are more than welcome to fix it! At the very least, please share this information with your buddy (or someone) at some point so we can make the team/platform better. (You can also file issues and pull requests on [the template for Onboarding issues](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/OnboardingChecklist.md).)
- [ ] Read [the team onboarding document](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/Onboarding.md) for more context about cloud.gov.
- [ ] Bookmark the [pertinent links listed here](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/PertinentLinks.md).
- [ ] Read the ["What is it?"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nCcti3dXG9TVGW3OqaWtnf96oXX8U8SBTM_WePFO_dg/edit#slide=id.p) presentation for a rundown of what cloud.gov is and does (specifically read slides 1-37; the rest are somewhat outdated)
- [ ] Read through [the Overview section of cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/overview/) for a broader understanding of cloud.gov, especially as we present it to potential customers/users.
- [ ] Read the [January 2016 cloud.gov "Executive Business Case" document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/138OcG0Lt6gr9J0wM0TzzPNyTROmYAwfLIDujtweiwGw/edit#) for greater context about cloud.gov's potential impact in government.
- [ ] [Deploy a sample application to cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/your-first-deploy/) to get familiar with the basics of the PaaS from a user's perspective.
- [ ] Sign up for a [Favro account](https://favro.com/signup) using your GSA Google Account.
- [ ] Check out the [Favro cloud.gov Program
  board](https://favro.com/organization/1e11108a2da81e3bd7153a7a/0b64f44bc57f65052fad8244) and make sure you have access to all our Favro boards.
- [ ] Check out the [roadmap](https://favro.com/organization/1e11108a2da81e3bd7153a7a/0b64f44bc57f65052fad8244) (with [additional longer-term info in Aha](https://18f.aha.io/products/CGP/feature_cards)) to get a high-level view of recently-completed, in-progress, and upcoming features.
- [ ] Read the [Delivery Process document](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/DeliveryProcess.md) to learn about how we work.
- [ ] Join [the cloud.gov team Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/?hl=en#!forum/cloud-gov) so you can participate in teamwide internal communication.
- [ ] Join the [cloud.gov inquiries Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/cloud-gov-inquiries) so you can keep apprised of prospective new clients.
- [ ] Bookmark the [cloud.gov Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx6EvBXVDWwheUtVckVnOE1pRzA) - that's where we put cloud.gov docs. If you create or move a doc there, it'll get the right access permissions for 18F team members to be able to view and edit it.
- [ ] Consider joining [Cloud Foundry's Slack channels](https://slack.cloudfoundry.org/) (we sometimes talk to folks in #gov and #gov-private – you'll need a cloud.gov team member to invite you to the latter).
- [ ] If you haven't already, [request a license for Microsoft Office](https://handbook.18f.gov/gsa-tools-equipment-and-transit/#get-a-copy-of-microsoft-office) - this is helpful for working with compliance documentation.
