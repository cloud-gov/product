# Onboarding Checklist

## Instructions

When someone new joins the cloud.gov team:

1. Create a new card in the [cg-private Github repo](https://github.com/18F/cg-private/issues/) called "Onboard [NewPerson]".
2. View the raw source of this file.
3. Copy the text before the checklists to the Description field of the card.
3. Copy each applicable block of tasks into a its own new task list on the card, replacing "NewPerson" with the new person's name and  "Buddy" with the onboarding buddy's name.
4. Submit the card.
5. Assign the person who bravely volunteered to be the new person's Onboarding Buddy to the card.
6. Put the issue into the _Doing_ column.

---

In order to get NewPerson productively contributing to the cloud.gov team, Buddy should help NewPerson complete a prescribed set of tasks that will bring them up to speed.

## Directions

**NewPerson and Buddy:** Try to go through your checklists in order.

**Buddy:** If you can’t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that someone with the correct access completes that item_.

## New Person checklist

### Getting to know cloud.gov

- [ ] Take judicious notes on what about this onboarding process or cloud.gov is confusing or frustrating. If you notice a problem (especially with things like documentation), you are more than welcome to fix it! At the very least, please share this information with your buddy (or someone) at some point so we can make the team/platform better. (You can also file issues and pull requests on [the template Onboarding checklist](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/OnboardingChecklist.md].)
- [ ] Figure out who your onboarding buddy is (they should reach out to you) and make sure this issue is assigned to them in our [ZenHub tracking board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/cg-story-board-5d217e937454737fd4fcffc8/board).
- [ ] Read [the team onboarding document](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/Onboarding.md) for more context about cloud.gov.
- [ ] Bookmark the [pertinent links listed here](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/PertinentLinks.md).
- [ ] Read the ["cloud.gov: What is it?"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nCcti3dXG9TVGW3OqaWtnf96oXX8U8SBTM_WePFO_dg/edit#slide=id.p) presentation for a rundown of what cloud.gov is and does (specifically read slides 1-37; the rest are somewhat outdated)
- [ ] Read through [the Overview section of our site](https://cloud.gov/overview/) for a broader understanding of cloud.gov, especially how we present it to potential customers and users.
- [ ] Read the [January 2016 cloud.gov "Executive Business Case" document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/138OcG0Lt6gr9J0wM0TzzPNyTROmYAwfLIDujtweiwGw/edit#) for greater context about cloud.gov's potential impact in government.
- [ ] Read the [House Oversight and Government Reform Committee (July 12 2017) document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDJdaPw7DSBPSa-XH-YsQpJVOmRKSK8sAghNhPFpegE/edit) for official answers to important questions such as "Why would agencies use cloud.gov instead of building their own?"
- [ ] [Sign up for a cloud.gov account with your GSA email address](https://cloud.gov/signup/).
- [ ] [Deploy a sample application to cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/quickstart/) to get familiar with the basics of the PaaS from a user's perspective.
- [ ] Read the [Delivery Process document](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/DeliveryProcess.md) to learn about how we work.
- [ ] We use a [ZenHub tracking board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/cg-story-board-5d217e937454737fd4fcffc8/board) to combine some Github repositories for [managing story lifecycles](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/StoryLifecycle.md).
- [ ] Read our [service disruption guide](https://cloud.gov/docs/ops/service-disruption-guide/) to learn how we handle customer-facing service disruptions.
- [ ] Join [the cloud.gov team Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/?hl=en#!forum/cloud-gov) so you can participate in team-wide internal communication.
- [ ] Join the [cloud.gov inquiries Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forum/#!forum/cloud-gov-inquiries) so you can keep apprised of prospective new clients.
- [ ] Add the [cloud.gov Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bx6EvBXVDWwheUtVckVnOE1pRzA) to your Google Drive -- that's where we put cloud.gov docs. If you create or move a doc there, it'll get the right access permissions for team members to be able to view and edit it.
- [ ] Once you've finished the checklists below, make suggestions for steps that would have improved your onboarding experience as pull requests on [the onboarding checklist template](https://github.com/18F/cg-product/blob/master/OnboardingChecklist.md) used to make this issue.

### Required items for all team members

These items help us fulfill security and compliance requirements (including for FedRAMP). If you get stuck, or if these requirements are confusing, ask for help from your buddy or in a cloud.gov channel.

Pre-requisites:

- [ ] Complete [GSA OLU](https://gsaolu.gsa.gov/) GSA Mandatory Cyber Security and Privacy Training, including accepting the GSA IT Rules of Behavior, which is required before we can give you access to any cloud.gov systems.
